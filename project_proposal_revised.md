### Description: 
The project uses historical weather data and campsite utilization rates across German states to develop actionable insights into what factors influence campsite occupancy. The analysis of the underlying core research in this study on weather, campsite visitation trends, and demographic determinants will enable the campsite operators to be better prepared for seasonal demands and anticipate the patterns of utilization during those particular weather conditions.

### Data Types  

- **Weather Data**
- **Campsite Utilization Data**

### Questions to Ask  

- How does the variation in temperature influence the level of occupancy at the campsites within the different states of Germany, and are there any thresholds beyond which occupancy spikes or falls sharply?

- What months does the use of campsites peak, and what are the climatic conditions for those months of high occupancy?

- Can we predict campsite occupancy based on forecasted weather conditions? How might these predictions improve resource planning and staffing during peak and off-peak seasons?

- Are there any particular weather patterns that predict a period of low or high utilization, and how would that inform the campsite operators for better resource allocation?

### Intellectual Merit 
1. **Predictive Modeling for Weather-Dependent Tourism**:  Most of the forecasting models target broader tourism sectors and are not focused on certain small-scale outdoors, such as camping. This project tries to show how well predictive models forecast campsite occupancy based on weather conditions and will add knowledge specific to small-scale, weather-dependent sectors of tourism.

2. **Campsite Management – Optimization of Resources**:  Linked to the weather, the occupancy forecasts provided through this research will enable campsite operators to plan staffing, facility, and resource levels, especially for those in remote locations that cannot easily respond to short-term changes in demand.


3. **Regional Weather-Conditioned Behavior Analysis**:  This might reveal a kind of unique behavioral trend in campers coming from different regions in Germany and form the basis for further research in regional tourism and how weather affects resource demand in specific travel markets.

### Data Sourcing:
The dataset on weather parameters and campsite occupancy covers German states from January 2002 to May 2024. Thus, the dataset is rich in both historical and realtime data provided by Deutscher Wetterdienst and Statistische Bundesamt, so it is suitable for retrospective analysis and prediction.

### Research Objectives 
- **RO1**: Describe trends in weather and campsite utilization data. This will involve analyzing the changes in the German states' campsites occupancy rate and determining what kind of weather conditions drive it.

- **RO2**: Predict, with the aid of historic weather data, the amount of occupancy of the campsites. Also, through regression analysis, determine the probable occupancy of campsites given forecasted weather parameters, including temperature and precipitation.

- **RO3**: This supports the model chosen in RO2 for the occupancy level prediction, making sure that it is of quality, and can estimate correctly for the given dataset.

- **RO4**: To evaluate the relationships implied by the model identified in RO2, with particular attention to the role that weather conditions play in determining occupancy at campsites and highlighting any potential causal pattern arising for use in the planning of campsites' resources.
