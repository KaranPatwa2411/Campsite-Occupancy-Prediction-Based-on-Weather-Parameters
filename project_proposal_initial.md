11/25/2024

Keywords: Retail Data Analytics, Inventory Management, Demand Forecasting 

Description: 

Data Types:

Sales Transaction Data:
Inventory Levels:
Customer Traffic:

Questions to Ask:

If given the sales trends, will I be able to predict when stock of particular products will fall below the reorder point?

Peak Hours/Days: On which days or at what time of day does the store have the biggest sales, and how do you prepare for that?

Which products sell slower or faster than expected? In what ways can you optimize stock levels to avoid overstock or stockouts?

Intellectual Merit:
1. Predictive Modeling for Small-Scale Retailers:
Most of the inventory prediction models are developed for large retailers with huge datasets. However, my project may also uncover new learnings in terms of how predictive models can be tailored to small to medium-sized businesses. For example, identifying which models or pre-processing techniques work most effectively in such a scenario may fill up the missing knowledge in existing literature.

2. Improving Inventory Efficiency: This would enable the mapping of sales trends, stock levels, and consumer behavior to devise inventory optimization policies in greater detail than conventionally found.

3. Customer Behavior Understanding:
The data I gather can show certain peculiar patterns of consumer behavior unique to the demographic and target niche of my store. Thus, while many studies extend to larger populations, my research could find new patterns of purchasing behavior in niche markets that may be less explored through the literature.  

Data Sourcing:
The data regarding sales and inventory will be gathered from my own store from past 2-3 years and yes, it will be real-time data so i will have a lot of work to do on it.
